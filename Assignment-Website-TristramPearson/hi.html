   <h3 class="ex">MWll season 5 has had many large changes the biggest of which being the new battle royale map- Al-Baqarah fortress which is a similar size to the old MW2019 map Verdansk as well as the new vehicle the M-rap which is a heavily armoured vehicle with a grenade launcher and a turret on top and also a new weapon the M13c a BLK variant of the M13b. During the second half of the season, we also got to see the new game mode armoured Royale which uses the M-rap as the player respawn point and as a moving base.</h3>

   
   <h3 class="ex">Season 5 reloaded started with a bang as three new weapons got added to the game the lockman-shroud, pickaxe/Ice-axe and the Daemon, alongside these things there was also another mastery camo called Eddie's supreme surprise. Other than this the community is patiently waiting for the release of MWlll.
