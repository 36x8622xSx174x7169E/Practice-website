  <h3 class="ex">In the past month the release of Modern Warfare 3 has been announced,
  the open game beta will be playable from October 28th untill the full game comes out. Many people will be switching to MWlll as they have introduced the carry over system allowing your current camo's bundles and other things that you have worked so hard to get. MWlll will also be bringing back slide cancelling, a much loved aspect of the original MW2019 as well as many of the other movement mechanics that the COD community has missed so much. </h3>
